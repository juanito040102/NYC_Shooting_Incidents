# NYC SHOOTING INCIDENT DATA
## By Juan Zumarán

I created this website with a python notebook, using data from NYC Open Data, a public dataset with data for at least this year and the historic records. 

This project investigates the spatial and temporal relationships between shooting incidents in New York City, The core objective is not to claim any conclusion on the cause or nature of these incidents, but to visualize and analyze patterns that may reveal longstanding systemic inequalities across NYC boroughs. 

The final deliverable will be a series of interactive plotly visuals accompanied by a narrative that tell a data-driven story about the urban landscape of violence and poverty. This project is to be expressed digitally, not in print, and in an interactive way, not static. Ideally, this project could live in a repository in Github and later be developed into a static website in which the visualizations maintain their ability to be interactive.

# How to interact and use these visuals: A tutorial on how to be a user of plotly. 

Hovering over the data is useful.
Clicking on/off data points can be messy.
Zooming In/Out is different than the intuitive scroll. To zoom in on a visual, the user needs to make two clicks, one as a starter point, and then drag the cursor around to generate a window that once the user lets go, it will expand into screen and only show what the cursor selected.
Nothing is going to break over the user interacting.
