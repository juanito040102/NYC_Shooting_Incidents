# NYC Shooting Incidents

Information Visualization Project using Python Jupyter Notebooks to create plotly visualizations to analyze the data from the NYPD regarding shooting incidents in the city. 

# Overview

This project investigates spatial and temporal patterns in NYC shooting incidents (2006-2025) to visualize systemic urban inequalities. The analysis focuses on seasonality, frequency patterns, and demographic distributions across boroughs through interactive Plotly visualizations.

Core Objective: Visualize patterns that may reveal longstanding systemic inequalities — not to claim causation.


# Key Features

Interactive visualizations (Plotly) showing temporal patterns (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly)
Geospatial mapping of incidents with year-to-year comparison
Demographic analysis of victims and perpetrators
Interactive website hosted via GitHub Pages
Data-driven narrative about violence and urban landscape

# Data: 

NYPD Shooting Incident Data from NYC Open Data:

Historic: 2006-2024 (29,744 incidents)
Year-to-Date: 2025 (769 incidents)
Combined: 30,513 incidents over 18+ years


# Tools:

Python: Data cleaning & analysis (pandas, numpy)
Plotly: Interactive visualizations
Jupyter Notebook: Analysis environment
GitHub Pages: Static website hosting


# UX Research:

Users needed minimal guidance for Plotly interactions (hover, zoom, filter)
Desire for cross-dataset analysis with complementary data (poverty, policing)
Clear narrative structure enhances comprehension
Interactive elements increase engagement with complex data

# Next Steps

Cross-analysis with socioeconomic data
ARIMA modeling for predictive insights
Enhanced filtering capabilities
Deeper demographic intersectionality analysis

This project is presented as a digital, interactive exploration — not a static print analysis. All visualizations maintain interactivity when deployed.
